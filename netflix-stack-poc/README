Requirements
============
- Vagrant
- VirtualBox

Running the reference application
=================================
1) Start the Vagrant VM:

vagrant up

This process may take 3-5 minutes.

2) SSH into the new Vagrant VM:

vagrant ssh

If running on Windows and without cygwin, this may not work so SSH into the VM using an SSH client (like PuTTY). Use 10.10.10.30 as the host, port 22, and vagrant/vagrant as credentials.

3) Build the Docker container, and start it:

cd dockerfiles/netflix-recipe-rss
./startRecipeRss.sh

The bootstrap script will first build the Docker container with the needed components (Eureka, middle tier and edge tier) and automatically start it. The process may take 5-10 minutes.

4) Access the application from the host: http://10.10.10.30:9090/jsp/rss.jsp (port 9090 in the Vagrant host is forwarded to port 9090 in the Docker container that runs the applications). 

It takes about 2-3 minutes until the RSS components (edge and middle tier) find the Eureka service registry and start working.

Troubleshooting
===============
The Docker container has an SSH daemon running and it's possible to log in (as if it was any other server) from the Vagrant host:

ssh root@localhost -p 1301

Use root/root.

Application logs can be found under /var/log/supervisor; rss-edge.log and rss-middletier.log contain the logs from the RSS recipe components. 

Eureka runs in a Tomcat server and its logs can be found in /var/log/tomcat7.
