This Vagrant image is used for running meteor(ite) applciations. Detailed
instructions about the set-up and usage can be found from the blog at
https://blog.accenture.com/ilkka_anttonen/2014/04/15/building-and-using-a-virtualized-runtime-for-meteorite-applications/.

The following prerequisites need to be installed and working:
	* VirtualBox
	* Vagrant
	* Cygwin with OpenSSH and rsync

The components that are installed in the image:
	* Meteor
	* Meteorite
	* Node
	* NPM
	* A couple of tools like joe and tmux settings

Rsync is used to share the folder "c:\users\<user.name>\projects" from the
host to the guest. After provisioning with vagrant, leave the command
"vagrant rsync-auto" running on the host to ensure that the folders keep
in sync.
