This vagrant file will set up a Ubuntu 14.04 box on VirtualBox with
local networking enabled that will run in 10.10.10.30. It will contain
the docker executable which is pulled from the docker repository.

Prerequisites:
 - VirtualBox
 - Vagrant
   - vagrant-vbguest plugin ("vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest")
     (This keeps the VirtualBox guest additions in synch so shared
     folders work)
 - Ansible (Linux, OS X only - will use the Shell provisioner in Windows)

Usage:
  vagrant up

This will download the box from canonical if it doesn't exist in the
local cache. It will then use ansible to provision the rest. It will
also install the correct version of the VirtualBox guest additions.

You can then connect to the box using either "vagrant ssh" or just "ssh
root@10.10.10.30" with the password "vagrant".

Note: If you get an ssh error when provisioning, remove the relevant
entries from the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file.

After you have logged in, the dockerfiles for building the docker
images can be found from ~/dockerfiles. Building and running the core
image would be:
  cd dockerfiles/core
  sudo docker build -t test/core .

Then you can list the images using:
  sudo docker images

And start the core image with the supplied script or:
  sudo docker run -d -p 1000:22 -p 9200:9200 -p 80:80 -p 8500:8500 -h core --name core --dns 127.0.0.1 $IMAGE_NAME

The -p options bind the ports to the container, so that then you can
try accessing the running riak instance from the host with a web browser
from the url "http://10.10.10.30:80" which displays the Kibana UI for
LogStash. Also ssh should work with "ssh root@10.10.10.30 -p 1000" and the
password "root" (given in the Dockerfile).
