This container includes the following:
	- Consul (runs in bootstrap mode as the Consul master node)
	- Logstash 1.4.1
	- ElasticSearch 1.1.1
	- Nginx + Kibana

Core acts as the place to push the logs to using rsyslog and also
acts as the base container for Consul. The startup script names the
container "core" and when it is linked in other containers (using
the command line switch --link core:core) the other consul agents
can connect to it using just the hostname "core".

Consul UI can be found from the address http://10.10.10.30:8500/ui

Kibana UI can be found from the address http://10.10.10.30

TODO:
	- Configure logstash to read local syslog messages on core
	- Test that rsyslog can deliver messages from other containers
	- General: in startup scripts check that core-container is running when starting others
