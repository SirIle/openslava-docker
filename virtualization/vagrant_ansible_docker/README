This vagrant file will set up a Ubuntu 13.10 box on VirtualBox with
local networking enabled that will run in 10.10.10.30. It will contain
the docker executable which is pulled from the docker repository.

Prerequisites:
 - VirtualBox
 - Vagrant
 - Ansible

Usage:
  vagrant up

This will download the box from canonical if it doesn't exist in the
local cache. It will then use ansible to provision the rest.

You can then connect to the box using either "vagrant ssh" or just "ssh
root@10.10.10.30" with the password "vagrant".
