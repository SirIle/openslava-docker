First version, stand alone for now, start script for clustering and pipework will follow shortly.

Build with:

	sudo docker build -t test/cassandra .

Start with:

	sudo docker start -p 9160:9160 -p 9042:9042 -h cassandra1 test/cassandra

Note: For now cassandra expects to find a seed node from "cassandra1", so it should be used as the host name for now.

Test with DataStax devcenter and point it to: 10.10.10.30 and it should work, try for example:

	CREATE KEYSPACE demo WITH REPLICATION = { 'class' : 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 1 };

	CREATE TABLE demo.users ( 
		userid text,
		firstname text,
		lastname text, 
		PRIMARY KEY (userid) 
	);


	INSERT INTO demo.users (userid, firstname, lastname)
	VALUES ('ile','Ilkka','Anttonen');

	SELECT * FROM demo.users;

and the result should be returned.
