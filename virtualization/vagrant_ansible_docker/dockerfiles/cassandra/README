First version, stand alone for now, start script for clustering and pipework will follow shortly.

Build with:

	sudo docker build -rm -t test/cassandra .

Note: To be able to run the cluster, you need to start the nodens DNS server first. From this folder
it can be started with:

	../nodens/startNodens.sh

Start the Cassandra instances with:

	./startCassandra <INSTANCE_NUMBER>

First instance should be 1 so that the correct ports are exposed to the host. The memory limits have been
configured to be quite small (max heap 128M) so that more simultaneous instances can be started. This 
value can be changed in the Dockerfile.

After subsequent instances are started they should join the ring automatically. Internally they are
known with the names cassandraX.local, where X is the instance number. The ssh ports are exposed to
the host as 102X with X being the instance number.

Test with DataStax devcenter and point it to: 10.10.10.30 and it should work, try for example:

	CREATE KEYSPACE demo WITH REPLICATION = { 'class' : 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 2 };

	CREATE TABLE demo.users ( 
		userid text,
		firstname text,
		lastname text, 
		PRIMARY KEY (userid) 
	);


	INSERT INTO demo.users (userid, firstname, lastname)
	VALUES ('ile','Ilkka','Anttonen');

	SELECT * FROM demo.users;

and the result should be returned.
