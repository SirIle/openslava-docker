Quick steps to executing a meteorite project:
  1) Start nodens container (../nodens/startNodens.sh)
  2) Start mongodb container (../mongodb/startMongoDB.sh)
  3) Start meteorite container (./startMeteorite.sh <PROJECT_DIR>)

..where <PROJECT_DIR> is the directory to expose as the working directory
for meteorite. NOTE: The directory path must be absolute. It can be an exposed 
directory from the Vagrant host, so that you can use your favourite editor 
running on the host OS to edit the files and they are exposed all the way to the
meteorite container.

Currently meteorite isn't automatically started, the
easiest way is to ssh to the container (ssh root@10.10.10.30 -p 1131),
password is "root" and just start meteorite with mrt.

The database has been set to use the mongodb running in another container.

There is an example project included and the startup is:

	../nodens/startNodens.sh
	../mongodb/startMongoDB.sh
	./startMeteorite.sh /home/vagrant/dockerfiles/meteorite/MeteorProjects/CoffeeTest
	ssh root@10.10.10.30 -p 1131
	cd /project
	mrt

Then you can point the browser on the host to 10.10.10.30:3000 and you should see the
welcome page.
