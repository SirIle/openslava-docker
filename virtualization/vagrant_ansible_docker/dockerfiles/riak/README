The files in this directory can be used to build a docker image that
will run a Riak server as well as an sshd.

Building the image:
  sudo docker build -t "<your_name>/riak" .

Listing the images:
  sudo docker images

Start the riak image with:
  sudo docker run -p 8098:8098 -p 8087:8087 -p 10022:22 test/riak

The -p options bind the ports to the container, so that then you can
access the running riak instance from the host with a web browser
from the url "http://10.10.10.30:8098/riak/test". Also ssh swork with
"ssh root@10.10.10.30 -p 10022", password is "basho" (given in the 
Dockerfile).
