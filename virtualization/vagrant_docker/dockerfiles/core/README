This container includes the following:
	- Consul (to be run in bootstrap mode as the Consul master node)
	- Logstash 1.4.1
	- ElasticSearch 1.1.1
  - Nginx + Kibana

It will act as the main place to push the logs to using rsyslog. Kibana UI is
exposed to the outside from port 80.

It has a static IP address of 10.1.1.1 essentially replacing NodeNS
container.

In the 10.1.x.x address space it will act as a DNS server (or can the
Consul-agents be used locally?)

Consul installation may later move to the parent container as all the nodes
should be running Consul.

TODO:
	- Configure logstash to read local syslog messages on core
	- Test that rsyslog can deliver messages from other containers
	- General: in startup scripts check that core-container is running when starting others
