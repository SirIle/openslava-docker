This container will include the following:
	- Consul (to be run in bootstrap mode as the Consul master node)
	- Logstash
	- ElasticSearch / Kibana

It will act as the main place to push the logs to using rsyslog.

It will have a static IP address of 10.1.1.1 essestially replacing NodeNS
container.

In the 10.1.x.x address space it will act as a DNS server (or can the
Consul-agents be used locally?)

Consul installation may later move to the parent container as all the nodes
should be running Consul.
