This container includes the following:
	- Consul (to be run in bootstrap mode as the Consul master node)
	- Logstash 1.4.1
	- ElasticSearch 1.1.1
  - Nginx + Kibana

It will act as the main place to push the logs to using rsyslog. Kibana UI is
exposed to the outside from port 80.

It has a static IP address of 10.1.1.1 essentially replacing NodeNS
container.

Consul installation may later move to the parent container as all the nodes
should be running Consul.

Consul UI can be found from the address http://10.10.10.30:8500/ui

TODO:
	- Configure logstash to read local syslog messages on core
	- Test that rsyslog can deliver messages from other containers
	- General: in startup scripts check that core-container is running when starting others
