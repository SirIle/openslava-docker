Opscenter is a tool by Datastax for monitoring Cassandra clusters. For
Opscenter and the Cassandra dock to work, Core has to be running. It can
be started with:

	../core/startCore.sh

Then start the Opscenter with the command:

	startOpscenter.sh

After Opscenter has been started, you can access it using a web browser by
going to the address:

	10.10.10.30:8888

When Cassandra nodes start, they will automatically start a datastax-client
which reports status information to Opscenter.

When you configure the cluster, you can use address "cassandra.service.consul"
or "cassandra1.node.consul".
