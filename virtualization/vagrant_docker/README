This is a test of new Vagrant 1.6.3 direct support for Docker containers.
At the moment things don't work too well as Vagrant 1.6.3 has multiple bugs
and it's suggested to wait until they can get them fixed.

The "core" container doesn't build properly for some reason most probably
related to boot2docker-VM that Vagrant uses as the default for running
containers.

The "bare" container can be started with "vagrant up -provider=docker bare"
and it can be reached with "vagrant ssh bare", but that's basically it. At
the moment you're better off using the "vagrant_ubuntu_docker" virtual
machine and using Docker there.

If someone can figure out how the ports can be exposed to the host (or what
IP the boot2docker default host gets), please add the information to this
README-file.
