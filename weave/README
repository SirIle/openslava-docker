First start weave in one of the nodes like this (node1):
  sudo weave launch 10.0.0.1/16

Make sure that the containers have been built (by running the command
./buildContainers.sh in ~/dockerfiles folder).

Containers can be launched via the script in ~/weave directory:
  ./startNode1.sh

They can also be started individually.

A bit of magic has been added to Consul and Cassandra startups so that the
bootstrap IP is determined at run time. A shell script is used to check if
the interface "ethwe" exists and the IP address provided by it is used. If
no such interface is found, then the IP address is obtained by using
"hostname -i" which gives the Docker internal IP. This way the containers should
work both in weaver and normal environments.

Joining the clusters (for example on node2)
  consul join -wan 10.0.1.1

Restart Cassandra on one of the nodes (for example Cassandra4)
