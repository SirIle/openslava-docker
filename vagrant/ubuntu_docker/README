This vagrant file will set up a Ubuntu 14.04 box on VirtualBox with
local networking enabled that will run in 10.10.10.30. It contains
a Docker environment and orchestration services.

Prerequisites:
 - VirtualBox
 - Vagrant
   - vagrant-vbguest plugin ("vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest")
     (This keeps the VirtualBox guest additions in synch so shared
     folders work)
 - Ansible (Linux, OS X only - will use the Shell provisioner in Windows)

Usage:
  vagrant up

This will download the box from canonical if it doesn't exist in the
local cache. It will then use ansible to provision the rest. It will
also install the correct version of the VirtualBox guest additions.

You can then connect to the box using either "vagrant ssh" or just "ssh
root@10.10.10.30" with the password "vagrant".

Note: If you get an ssh error when provisioning, remove the relevant
entries from the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file.

After you have logged in, the dockerfiles for building the docker
images can be found from ~/dockerfiles.

Building the files needed to run the Cassandra example happens by running:
	./buildCassandra.sh

Then you can list the images using:
  sudo docker images

Starting the orchestrated cassandra example:
	maestro -f cassandra.yaml start

Status can be checked with:
	maestro -f cassandra.yaml status

Cluster can be stopped with:
	maestro -f cassandra.yaml stop

And start the core image with the supplied script or:
  sudo docker run -d -p 1000:22 -p 9200:9200 -p 80:80 -p 8500:8500 -h core --name core --dns 127.0.0.1 $IMAGE_NAME

Consul UI can be accessed with a browser at "http://10.10.10.30:8500/ui".

Kibana (UI for Logstash) can be found at "http://10.10.10.30".

If you want to ssh to the containers, the ports are 1000 for core, 1021-3 for cassandra and
1121 for opscenter. Username and password for all is "root".
